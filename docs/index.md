# Hypermap Registry

Hypermap Registry is a platform that manages OWS, Esri REST, and other types of map service harvesting, and orchestration and maintains uptime statistics for services and layers. Where possible, layers will be cached by MapProxy. It is anticipated that other types of OGC service such as WFS, WCS, WPS, as well as flavors of Esri REST and other web-GIS protocols will eventually be included. The platform is initially being developed to collect and organize map services for Harvard WorldMap, but there is no dependency on WorldMap. The initial funding for Hypermap Registry came from a grant to the Center for Geographic Analysis from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

CGA maintains a live instance of Hypermap Registry at this url: http://hh.worldmap.harvard.edu

If you want to test create a local instance of Hypermap you can follow the [installation instructions](installation.md). If you need a good viewer for consuming the layers you could install and try [GeoNode WorldMap](installation_wm.md).

You can then use the [tutorial](tutorial.md) to understand the way it works and its features. Here you can check more details about [its architecture](architecture.md)

Here you can find the [changes log](changelog.md)
